Hello NHS,
This is my github repository for the assessment and just wanted to let you know how it works
This application uses express for its API and Jest for testing. I have tried my best to make it Restful however i was a little confused with the task.
The scenarios are all AI generated, However i can attest to the fact that, that is the maximum extent AI has been used in this application.

To run a test, clone it and then npm i all the packages. The shell of the application was generated by webstorm which is why theres some empty folders. 
The main code is in **routes/scenario.js**, the data is in **utils/scenarioData.js** and the test is off course in the test folder. 
A simple test for this API can be done through 
"http://localhost:3000/api/scenario/options" which shows all avaliable options to you and to see the actual code running you can use the URL.
The actual URL is http://localhost:3000/api/scenario?technology=Cloud Computing&role=System Administrator&environment=Cloud Infrastructure"
